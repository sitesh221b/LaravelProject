In this project, our main idea is to support stray dogs. We have basically created three main modules in it, which is as following :
  1.) One can report the dogs on our website like where they find the dogs, their breed, their count and we'll later forward their data to the main office which takes care of the dogs.
  2.) One can also purchase dogs which they might find nice for themselves.
  3.) We will also post the dogs on our website so that our users can select an appropriate breed dog for themselves.
  
 To sum up, we've tried to build something which will take care of dogs and in return our society will be more safer and happy. :-)
